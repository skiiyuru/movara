Many organizations keep executing their plans without stopping to check if their strategy still works.

The risk is obvious: you could reach year-end having spent time and resources on things that no longer matter.

A mid-year or periodic strategy review gives you the clarity you need to finish strong. Here's how to do it right:

## Evaluate Performance Metrics Against Your Goals

Check your KPIs: revenue, costs, customer growth, or other key measures.
Are you where you expected to be?

## Review Progress on Strategic Initiatives

Which projects are on track, stalled, or no longer relevant?
Are they still aligned with your broader strategy?

## Assess Strategic Alignment with Your Mission

Do your initiatives connect directly to your mission and long-term goals?

## Scan for Market and Environmental Shifts

What has changed since you set your plan?
Competitor moves, regulatory changes, technological shifts?

## Identify Gaps and Barriers Slowing Execution

What's truly holding you back — missing skills, resource constraints, implementation challenges?
How can you turn these insights into corrective actions?

## Reset Goals and Execution Plans

Refocus priorities, adjust timelines, and reallocate resources.
Make sure your team knows exactly what matters most for the rest of the year.

## The Point

A mid-year review isn't about creating a new strategy. It's about sharpening execution on the one you already have.

When was the last time you truly paused to look at where your business stands?

At Movara Horizons, we help leadership teams step back, assess progress, and reset for stronger execution so that strategies stay relevant and deliver results.
