Kenya's SACCO sector is now almost a quarter the size of the national budget.

According to the **SASRA** Sacco Supervision Annual Report, 2024, the sector recorded:

- **KShs 1.076 trillion** in assets
- **KShs 845.11 billion** in loans (**+11.41%**)
- **KShs 197.54 billion** in capital reserves (**+17.55%**)

These numbers reflect the deep trust of the **7.4 million members** who rely on SACCOs to manage their savings, access credit, and build their financial futures.

But behind this impressive growth, there are cracks that can't be ignored.

- **Non-performing loans remain above 8%**, well beyond the regulatory benchmark of 5%.
- Several SACCOs dipped into their **capital reserves** last year to cover losses from poor investments in unregulated instruments.

This is why SACCOs need to lean more deliberately into **data-driven decision-making**.

And to be clear, this isn't about starting from scratch. Most SACCOs already track performance, run credit scoring, and generate regulatory reports. The next step is to **strengthen these foundations** with capabilities that inform strategy — not just compliance.

## Strengthened Data Capabilities Could Mean:

- Predictive models that flag risky loans before defaults escalate.
- Stress tests to assess how investments hold up under different scenarios.
- Integrated dashboards that give boards a real-time picture of loans, deposits, NPLs, and liquidity.
- Member insights that guide financial literacy initiatives and tailored services.
- Building a culture where big decisions are consistently anchored in evidence.

The trillion-shilling milestone is remarkable. The real question is whether SACCOs will use data to **translate scale into lasting member value** — or let the cracks widen.
