Early in my tech career, we had a running joke:
**"If customers are happy and revenue is up, customer service is working. If not, it must be Tech's fault."**

We laughed it off. But it pointed to something real. Tech work is often invisible until something breaks.

The issue isn't that tech teams don't deliver value. It's that their work often isn't clearly linked to business outcomes.

The solution isn't working harder. It's not more status meetings. It's **showing how technology connects to what the business cares about**.

## Here's What That Looks Like

### Set One Clear Annual Goal

What are we trying to achieve this year and why does it matter to the business?
*Example: "Support 20% revenue growth through digital modernization."*

### Choose 3–5 Business-Focused Metrics

Not "deploy 12 features" but "new features will reduce customer churn by 15%."

### Break the Goal Into 3–5 Strategic Focus Areas

Mix operations with transformation.
*Example: For "Improve retention by 30%," upgrade support platforms and build churn prediction analytics.*

### Turn Focus Areas Into Time-Bound Tasks

Each with clear owners and outcomes. This is how invisible work becomes visible.

### Set a Regular Review Rhythm

Track business impact, flag blockers, and adjust focus to stay aligned.

## The Outcome

Tech teams who do this move from "support" functions to **strategic partners**.

What invisible value is your tech team creating that leadership doesn't see yet?
