If you're only using AI to improve operations, you're missing the bigger point.

AI can do more than cut costs, automate tasks, and enhance service. It can **reshape how your business competes and grows**, opening doors to entirely new revenue streams.

Take **M-Pesa**. It didn't just digitize existing payments. It created a whole new financial ecosystem. Many banks focusing only on incremental digitization missed the larger shift.

With AI, the same dynamic applies. Businesses that use it only to automate tasks will be overtaken by those who build **AI-powered business models**.

In a recent Harvard Business Review article — *"Is Incrementalism Holding Back Your AI Strategy?"* — the authors argue that many firms are missing the forest for the trees. They're focused on optimizing processes today instead of reimagining their business models for the AI era.

They make the point that true transformation requires more than efficiency gains — it demands structural reinvention.

## How to Start

### Think Beyond Automation

Ask: How can AI help you serve customers in new, previously impossible ways?

### Run "What If" Scenarios

What if AI redefines your entire business in five years?

### Test, Learn, Scale

Start small, measure outcomes, double down on what works. Transformation is a journey, not a single initiative.

## The Real Opportunity

AI can optimize operations. But used strategically, it has the power to **transform your business model**. And that's where the biggest value lies.

At Movara Horizons, we help leaders do more than upgrade operations. We partner with them to **reimagine their business around AI**, turning potential into lasting advantage.
