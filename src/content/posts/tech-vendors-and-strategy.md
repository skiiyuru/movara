Tech vendors can contribute to your strategy.

But adopting their roadmaps to become your strategy? That's a stretch.

I've sat through many of those vendor presentations in my previous roles. The vendor walks in with polished demos, bold promises, and a step-by-step plan that looks like salvation. My team frantically screenshots every slide.

Finally, someone who has all the answers.

But that roadmap wasn't built for your business. It was built to showcase their product.

## The Vendor Incentive

Most vendors are incentivized to sell technology solutions — not to question your business model or align technology to your long-term ambition. That's your job.

When you adopt the vendor roadmap as-is, you risk optimizing for what the tool does — not for what your business actually needs.

## How to Shape the Direction

Here's how to shape the direction:

### Start with Business Outcomes

Ask: "What problem are we solving?" Not: "What features are available?"

### Define Your Future State First

What will success look like? Better customer experience? Improved efficiency? Map out this vision before any vendor enters the room.

### Set Your Own Priorities

Use your strategic goals — not vendor timelines — to decide what matters most and when.

### Engage Stakeholders Early

This builds alignment, surfaces hidden risks, and ensures the solution reflects how the business actually works.

## The Reality

Once your vision is clear, bring vendors in to help execute. You'll be in a position to ask better questions, negotiate smarter, and stay focused on results.

Vendors can deliver working systems. But only you can design a system that drives real transformation.

At Movara Horizons, we help leadership teams **shape technology strategies that align with business ambition**, ensuring vendors fit into your roadmap, not the other way around.
