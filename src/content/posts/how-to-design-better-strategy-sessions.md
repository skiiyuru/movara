Early in my strategy career, I led a strategy session that was… simply put, a mess.

The agenda was unclear, so the conversation wandered and lost focus. By the end, we had plenty of talk but zero direction.

It was a hard lesson: if you don't give collaboration some structure, you won't get meaningful results.

Whether it's a strategy workshop, planning session, or cross-functional meeting, **preparation is key**. Here's what I've found works:

## Define the Purpose Upfront

Define the purpose of the session before bringing teams together.

## Invite the Right Mix

Invite the right mix of expertise and experience. Don't just invite representatives from every department; ensure diverse perspectives.

## Create a Structured Agenda

Create a structured agenda to keep the session focused and productive. Lay out the main points and allow time for each.

## Facilitate Without Dominating

Facilitate without dominating. Guide the conversation and step in when it starts to wander.

## Summarize and Clarify

Summarize decisions, assign timelines, and clarify responsibilities before closing.

## Follow Up Quickly

Follow up quickly after the session. Provide regular updates and track progress to ensure accountability.

## The Key Insight

Great collaboration doesn't just happen. You have to **design it intentionally**.
Apply these principles, and you'll see your team collaborate with more focus, clarity, and impact.

At Movara Horizons, we help leadership teams design and facilitate strategic conversations that drive alignment and decisions, not just discussions.
