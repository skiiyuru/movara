I can predict which strategies will be unsuccessfully executed just by reading the strategy document.

Research consistently shows that while **70–90% of organizations have well-formulated strategies**, only **10–30% manage to execute them successfully**.

And when you read enough strategy documents, you start to spot the warning signs. They're right there on the page. Long before execution begins.

## The Red Flags of Execution Failure

### Vague, Unmeasurable Objectives

Documents filled with abstract language and buzzwords like "synergy," "transformation," and "optimization" without concrete definitions. Objectives stated in general terms, with no numbers attached. No targets. No measures. If the strategy isn't clear on what winning looks like, execution remains vague.

### No Link Between Strategy and Resources

Many documents are big on ambition but silent on resourcing. No clarity on budget. No sense of the people or technology required. No signal of trade-offs. High-performing companies don't separate strategy from resource allocation. They tie the two together from day one.

### Too Many Priorities

A laundry list of ten, fifteen, sometimes twenty "strategic priorities." Everything is urgent. Everything is important. Which really means…nothing is. Execution fails when teams are pulled in every direction.

### No Clear Ownership

A strategy with no real owners is just a wish list. Execution requires names. Clear accountability.

### No Roadmap, No Milestones

Many strategies stop at intent and never move into time-bound action. Without these, strategy becomes static.

## The Insight

You don't need to wait for quarterly reviews or missed KPIs to see execution failure coming.

The signs are already baked into the strategy document: vague objectives, no resource plan, too many priorities, unclear ownership, no roadmap, and no learning mechanism.

At Movara Horizons, we help leadership teams close these gaps. We design strategies that are clear, owned, resourced, and execution-ready. If you want your next strategy to be built for action, not just presentation, let's talk.
