Big companies are expected to move slowly.
Yet Salesforce, with over **76,000 employees**, grows faster than most startups.

How?
They cracked something over 90% of companies struggle with: **team alignment**.

They've built a way to keep thousands of people rowing in the same direction. Consistently, year after year.

## The Salesforce Alignment System

Every year, CEO Marc Benioff and his leadership team align around five key questions:

- What do we want to achieve?
- What matters most and will create the biggest impact?
- How will we implement it?
- What's standing in the way — and how do we remove it?
- How will we measure success?

The answers provide a **detailed map of where the company is going** — a map that guides every team, at every level.

## Why Alignment Matters

Most companies don't fail because of bad strategy.
They fail because no one knows what really matters. Priorities get buried. People pull in different directions. There's no cohesion.

Great alignment systems fix this by:

- Clarifying priorities
- Keeping progress visible
- Building accountability
- Making dependencies clear

Studies show aligned teams move faster, waste less time, and hit targets more often.

## Test Your Alignment

Does your team move like Salesforce's 76,000, or pull in different directions?

Most leaders think their teams are aligned. Test it.
Ask three people what your company's top priority is.
If you get three different answers, you've got work to do.

At Movara Horizons, we help leadership teams build alignment systems that cut through noise, focus priorities, and drive execution at scale. If you want your teams moving in the same direction, let's talk.
