In her [article](https://lnkd.in/dgNRTaqZ) published at the onset of the pandemic, Palak K. discussed the significance of focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) adapting to the reality of being conducted online.

While this is occurring in some areas of Africa, the majority of FGDs and IDIs are still conducted face-to-face.

Regardless of the model selected, the processes following the interview sessions must be digitised to improve accuracy and timeliness, and imla.io does just that.
